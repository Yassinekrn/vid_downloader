By Yassine Krichen

# v1.0 features:

- download any youtube video using it's url at it's highest quality
- download playlists from youtube (must be public)
- allow you to choose where to save your files

# How to init the program:

- first of all you must have a code editor (vscode is recommanded) as it will be used to run the program.
- You must also, install python on your device (easy to do using the official website of python)
- You must install the following libs in order for the program to work:
  - pytube
  - moviepy
  - tkinter & shutil (I think they are already installed with the latest version of python)
- in line 58, you must change the file="path" to the new path of your youtube.png (vscode can give you the exact path to put in there)

--> You are ready to run the program now!

# How to use the program:

- you first choose a dir (the place where you want to save your files)
  "if not selected, it will default to the path of the program"
- if you want to download a single video, you use the first field and regular download button, else in the case of a playlist you use the second field "Input Playlist" and hit the download playlist button.
- not using the program in it's intended way will result in crashes and problems with the download procedure
- when downloading a video | playlist, you must be patient and wait for the program to do its work, the app title will indicate whether the app is working or not.
  -spamming the app with clicks will result in a crash so avoid doing that and please keep waiting for the download to finish.
